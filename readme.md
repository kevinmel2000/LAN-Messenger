I created this small app on 2002 to communicate with my dorm-mates in a local area network. I also made this project as my final exam which brought me a straight A. I was so lucky hehe..

I put this source code on github just to secure my relic since it's original repository (planet-source-code.com) was having a bad crash which causing a huge data loss including this source code. Fortunately someone uploaded the source code to 4shared. Thanks to [Azwar Anas](http://www.4shared.com/u/uBF1PIiM/azwaranas004.html)!
